# Bi623 Project 2: Electric organ RNA-seq analysis

## Overall project:

In this project, you will process electric organ and/or skeletal muscle RNA-seq reads and then complete a differential expression analysis to address a biological question. You will learn how to use existing tools for quality assessment and read trimming, compare quality assessments to those created by your own software, how to align and count reads, and how to complete a differential expression analysis. At the end of project 2, you will summarize important information in a high-level report. You will create a cohesive, well written report for your "PI" about what you've learned from processing data to analysis.

**This template is provided as reference for instructions. Files with specific naming conventions are requested to be turned in at the end of this project. You can use this template to gather notes while completing this project**. Be sure to upload all relevant materials by the deadlines and **double check** to be sure that your offline repository is up-to-date with your online repository. Answers to questions should be included in output files. Be sure to keep a well-organized, detailed lab notebook!

### Dataset:

We will be working with RNA-seq reads from Camplylomormyrus fishes, originating from 2 projects (found on NCBI: PRJNA1005244 and PRJNA1005245). The methods for the PRJNA1005244 dataset are [published](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae021) and the methods for the PRJNA1005245 dataset are written in the third chapter of a [thesis](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/courses/266187/files/22059308?module_item_id=5380118).

For steps 1-3 of project 2, each of you will be working with 2 RNA-seq files. For all steps below, process the two libraries separately. SRR assignments are here: `/projects/bgmp/shared/Bi623/Project2/Project2_part1_3_data_assignments.txt`. You are responsible for downloading this data from NCBI SRA, dumping into FASTQ files, and zipping those files (check ICA1 for a refresher). Rename the files to the convention Species_sample_tissue\_[ageORsize]\_sample#\_readnumber.fastq.gz (follow the csv from the repository).

For steps 4-5 of project 2, people will have access to all of the counts files from these fishes. You are expected to identify a scientifically relevant hypothesis, and test it using these counts.

**Reminder: This template file IS not your final product; however, it gives you a space to record all of the necessary information for your final report.**

## For this project, your git repo should:

- [ ] Be properly organized (1 folder per part of the project)
- [ ] Contain your lab notebook
- [ ] Include all Talapas batch script/code
- [ ] Have all plots with detailed file names
- [ ] Only possess counts files generated from htseq-count that would be used in future differential RNA-seq analysis (**In their own folder; with the naming convention Species_sample_tissue\_[ageORsize]\_sample#*readnumber_htseqcounts*[revORyes]stranded.txt**)

## Part 1 Read quality score distributions, DUE 8/30

Create a folder called Project2_Part1 on your git repo. **Upload all of your answers and bash code from this section to Project2_Part1_answers.txt (located in Project2_Part1). Upload any plots created in this section to Project2_Part1 and give them detailed names.**

1.  Create a new environment with PIXI called `Project2_QAA` and install `FastQC`, `cutadapt`, and `Trimmomatic`. Reference the [PIXI manual](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/first_workspace/#pypi-dependencies) if you need a refresher. You should do this in an interactive session, not the login node! Record details of how you created this environment in your lab notebook! Make sure you check your installation with:
    - `fastqc --version` (should be v0.12.1)

[Record details on how you made the environment to your lab notebook]

2.  Using `FastQC` via the command line on Talapas, produce plots of the per-base quality score distributions for R1 and R2 reads. Also, produce plots of the per-base N content, and comment on whether or not they are consistent with the quality score plots.

3.  Run your quality score plotting script from your Demultiplexing assignment in Bi622. (Make sure you're using the "running sum" strategy!!) Describe how the `FastQC` quality score distribution plots compare to your own. If different, propose an explanation. Also, does the run time differ? Mem/CPU usage? If so, why?

4.  Comment on the overall data quality of your two libraries. Go beyond per-base qscore distributions. Examine the `FastQC` [documentation](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/) for guidance on interpreting results and planning next steps. Make and justify a recommendation on whether these data are of high enough quality to use for further analysis.

## Part 2 Adaptor trimming comparison, DUE 9/2

Create a folder called Project2_Part2 on your git repo. **Upload all of your answers and bash code from this section to Project2_Part2/Project2_Part2_answers.txt. Upload any R code to Project2_Part2/Project2_Part2_answers.R. Upload any plots created in this section to Project2_Part2 and give them detailed names.**

5.  If you haven't already in your Project2_QAA environment, install `Cutadapt` and `Trimmomatic`. Check your installations with:
    - `cutadapt --version` (should be 5.2)
    - `trimmomatic -version` (should be 0.40)

[Record details on install and/or version checking to your lab notebook]

6.  Using `Cutadapt`, properly trim adapter sequences from your assigned files. Be sure to read how to use `Cutadapt`. Use default settings. What proportion of reads (both R1 and R2) were trimmed?

    <details>

    <summary>Try to determine what the adapters are on your own. If you cannot (or if you do, and want to confirm), click here to see the actual adapter sequences used.</summary>

    R1: `AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA`

    R2: `AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT`

    </details>

    - *Sanity check*: Use your Unix skills to search for the adapter sequences in your datasets and confirm the expected sequence orientations. Report the commands you used, the reasoning behind them, and how you confirmed the adapter sequences.

7.  Use `Trimmomatic` to quality trim your reads. Specify the following, **in this order**:

    - LEADING: quality of 3
    - TRAILING: quality of 3
    - SLIDING WINDOW: window size of 5 and required quality of 15
    - MINLENGTH: 35 bases

    Be sure to output compressed files and clear out all intermediate files.

8.  Plot the trimmed read length distributions for both paired R1 and paired R2 reads (on the same plot - yes, you will have to use Python or R to plot this. See ICA4 from Bi621). You can produce 2 different plots for your 2 different RNA-seq samples. There are a number of ways you could possibly do this. One useful thing your plot should show, for example, is whether R1s are trimmed more extensively than R2s, or vice versa. Comment on whether you expect R1s and R2s to be adapter-trimmed at different rates and why.

9.  Bonus - Run `FastQC` on your trimmed data. Comment on differences you observe between the trimmed and untrimmed data. Include any figures needed to support your conclusions.

## Part 3 Alignment and strand-specificity, DUE 9/3

Create a folder called Project2_Part3 on your git repo. **Upload all of your answers and bash code from this section to Project2_Part3/Project2_Part3_answers.txt.**

10. Install additional software for alignment and counting of RNA-seq reads. In your Project2_QAA environment, use PIXI to install:
    - Star
    - Samtools
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - HTSeq

[Record details on how you installed these packages and what version they are to your lab notebook]

11. Download the publicly available *Campylomormyrus compressirostris* genome fasta and gff file from [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c59zw3rcj) and generate an alignment database from it. If the download fails, the files are available here: `/projects/bgmp/shared/Bi623/Project2/campylomormyrus.fasta`, `/projects/bgmp/shared/Bi623/Project2/campylomormyrus.gff`. Align the reads to your *C. compressirostris* database using a splice-aware aligner. Use the settings specified in PS8 from Bi621.

> [!IMPORTANT] You will need to use gene models to perform splice-aware alignment, see PS8 from Bi621 to remind yourself. You may need to convert the gff file into a gtf file for this to work successfully.

13. Using your script from PS8 in Bi621, report the number of mapped and unmapped reads from each of your 2 SAM files. Make sure that your script is looking at the bitwise flag to determine if reads are primary or secondary mapping (update/fix your script if necessary).

[Include the number of mapped and unmapped reads from both same files]

14. Count reads that map to features using `htseq-count`. You should run htseq-count twice: once with `--stranded=yes` and again with `--stranded=reverse`. Use default parameters otherwise. You may need to use the `-i` parameter for this run.

15. Demonstrate convincingly whether or not the data are from "strand-specific" RNA-Seq libraries **and** which `stranded=` parameter should you use for counting your reads for a future differential gene expression analyses. Include any commands/scripts used. Briefly describe your evidence, using quantitative statements (e.g. "I propose that these data are/are not strand-specific, because X% of the reads are y, as opposed to z."). This [kit](https://www.revvity.com/product/nex-rapid-dir-rna-seq-kit-2-0-8rxn-nova-5198-01) was used during library preparation. This [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article/19/5-6/339/5837822) may provide helpful information.

> [!TIP] Recall ICA4 from Bi621.

[Describe whether your reads are "strand-specific", why you think they are, any evidence, and which stranded parameter is appropriate and why]

16. BONUS - Turn your commands from this assignment into a script with a loop going through your two SRA files
